# Outline your hard to see blocks!

### Having a hard time counting how much obsidian in a bunch?
### Want to count how many magma blocks are in a row?
### Making a tutorial and want a more helpful guide for the viewer?
Drag and drop a color and you're set!

## Obsidian

## Potential Future:
- I want to make a website just like the [Default Dark Mode](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/default-dark-mode) Pack so it would just be easier than just dragging and dropping if you want to change the color.
It would also be easier for customization rather than the preset I provided.
- More presets lol

# Thank you for downloading the pack!
Feel free to add this to your own pack too!
